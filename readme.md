Most of the code and notes are from [Building a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)

Coding an LLM - 3 stages

Stage 1: Build the LLM

* Data prep and sampling
* Attention mechanism
* LLM architecture

Stage 2: Foundation model
